# Overview: Fitbit Analysis

Back when COVID was fiercly around and detrament to our society, my wife and I decided to buy Fitbit devices in order to encourage us to go outside and keep active. Initially, we used the tracker to monitor the number of steps we took each day and the distances we achieved, however, soon after we became interested in tracking our sleep quality as well. In partciular, we wanted to review our sleep to see whether we were getting a good rest before the future birth of our child. What began as a fun part of our morning routine, quickly became a competition of who would sleep BETTER AND LONGER. This competition quickly became one sided as my wife would normally beat me. Once our child was born, I became interested in checking whether change in our life would affect our sleep quality and if so to what effect.

I have since had a hypothesis that the quality of my sleep (both in terms of score* and length) decreased since the birth of my son (September 2021) and that it would gradually increase to its former levels naturally as they adapted to life.

*Caution statement*: at the point of starting the analysis it wasn't clear whether I have enough, consistent data to validate or reject the claim.

## Structure of the project:
  - Fitbit Sleep Analysis Final.ipynb - jupyter notebook with entire analysis
  - Sleep (folder) - contains all the data I used for the analysis


*note*: the Sleep Score by Fitbit is calculated automatically by the device and the methodology is not pulicly available.
